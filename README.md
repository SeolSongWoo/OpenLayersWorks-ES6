# VworldMap.js

This javascript provides a convenient way to work with Vworld map tiles using OpenLayers. It offers an easy-to-use interface for managing layers, markers, and events on a VworldMap instance. The library is built using JavaScript and OpenLayers, and it is designed to be both flexible and extensible.

## Features

- Initialize a VworldMap instance with a given tile source URL
- Manage layers using the LayerManager class
- Add, remove, and retrieve layers by their name or ID
- Manage markers using the MarkerManager class
- Add, remove, and retrieve markers by their name or type
- Set custom event handlers for marker clicks
- Manage event listeners using the EventListenerManager class
- Add click, pointer move, and map move start event listeners

## Usage

1. Import the VworldMap class from the library:

```javascript
import { VworldMap } from './path/to/VworldMap.js';
